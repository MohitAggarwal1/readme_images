## 📌 Purpose of This Repository

This repository is used **only to store images** that are referenced inside README files of other projects.

Instead of uploading images separately in every repository, all screenshots and assets are hosted here to:

* ✅ Keep project repositories clean
* ✅ Avoid duplicate image uploads
* ✅ Generate raw GitHub image links
* ✅ Maintain centralized image management
* ✅ Improve README performance

---

## 🗂️ How It Works

1. Upload images inside organized folders (e.g., project-name folder).
2. Copy the **raw GitHub image URL**.
3. Paste the link inside any other repository’s README.

Example Markdown usage:

```markdown
![Project Screenshot](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/your-username/repo-name/branch/folder/image.png)
```
